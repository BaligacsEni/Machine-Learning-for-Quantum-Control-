# Machine-Learning-for-Quantum-Control
In this short project I aim to go over the book "Learning and Robust Control in Quantum Technology" by Daoyi Dong and Ian R. Petersen, 2023 (Communications and Control Engineering).
I was interested in this book because my PhD research about NMR optimal Pulse engineering with AI is very similar. I hope to gain valuable insight by reading this book. 
To fully understand I created this project where I will summarize a few Chapters and  implement the numerical examples given in Python to gain a deeper understanding of the subjects of this book. 
Because I focus on my work here I will skip everything that I believe is notrelated enough to my work to be useful.
